You can add students to courses by entering their name ,course name and start time. Once you add the student classroom capacities increase. And if you exceed the classroom capacity, program reassign the lecture to the another classroom with larger capacity. Also as you can add the student, you can remove the student. Like before, once you removed a student from a course, capacity decreases.
